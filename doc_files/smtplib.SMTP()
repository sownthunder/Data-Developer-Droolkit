Init signature:
smtplib.SMTP(
    host='',

    timeout=<object object at 0x000002A5A334E6A0>,
    source_address=None,
)
Docstring:     
This class manages a connection to an SMTP or ESMTP server.
SMTP Objects:
    SMTP objects have the following attributes:
        helo_resp
            This is the message given by the server in response to the
            most recent HELO command.

        ehlo_resp
            This is the message given by the server in response to the
            most recent EHLO command. This is usually multiline.

        does_esmtp
            This is a True value _after you do an EHLO command_, if the
            server supports ESMTP.

        esmtp_features
            This is a dictionary, which, if the server supports ESMTP,
            will _after you do an EHLO command_, contain the names of the
            SMTP service extensions this server supports, and their
            parameters (if any).

            Note, all extension names are mapped to lower case in the
            dictionary.

    See each method's docstrings for details.  In general, there is a
    method of the same name to perform each SMTP command.  There is also a
    method called 'sendmail' that will do an entire mail transaction.
    
Init docstring:
Initialize a new instance.

If specified, `host' is the name of the remote host to which to
connect.  If specified, `port' specifies the port to which to connect.
By default, smtplib.SMTP_PORT is used.  If a host is specified the
connect method is called, and if it returns anything other than a
success code an SMTPConnectError is raised.  If specified,
`local_hostname` is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO
command.  Otherwise, the local hostname is found using
socket.getfqdn(). The `source_address` parameter takes a 2-tuple (host,
port) for the socket to bind to as its source address before
connecting. If the host is '' and port is 0, the OS default behavior
will be used.
