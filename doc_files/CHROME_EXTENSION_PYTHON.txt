I did this with Python in case anyone was looking.

All you have to do is download the .crx file 
(I used https://chrome-extension-downloader.com/) 
and save it somewhere that Python can access it. 
In my example, I imported it to the same folder as my Python script, to load exampleOfExtensionDownloadedToFolder.crx.

----------------------

from selenium import webdriver 
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options 

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_extension('./exampleOfExtensionDownloadedToFolder.crx')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=options) 
driver.get('http://www.google.com')
