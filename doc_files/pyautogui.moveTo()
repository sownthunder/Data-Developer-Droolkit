Signature: pyautogui.moveTo(
    x=None,
    y=None,

    pause=None,
    _pause=True,
)
Docstring:
Moves the mouse cursor to a point on the screen.

The x and y parameters detail where the mouse event happens. If None, the
current mouse position is used. If a float value, it is rounded down. If
outside the boundaries of the screen, the event happens at edge of the
screen.

Args:
  x (int, float, None, tuple, optional): The x position on the screen where the
    click happens. None by default. If tuple, this is used for x and y.
    If x is a str, it's considered a filename of an image to find on
    the screen with locateOnScreen() and click the center of.
  y (int, float, None, optional): The y position on the screen where the
    click happens. None by default.
  duration (float, optional): The amount of time it takes to move the mouse
    cursor to the xy coordinates. If 0, then the mouse cursor is moved
    instantaneously. 0.0 by default.
  tween (func, optional): The tweening function used if the duration is not
    0. A linear tween is used by default. See the tweens.py file for
    details.

Returns:
  None
