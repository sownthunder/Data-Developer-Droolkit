Signature: glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)
Docstring:
Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.

The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
patterns.

If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and
zero or more directories and subdirectories.
